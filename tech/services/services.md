## CI/CD

#### Adopt

[Serverless CI/CD](https://github.com/fogfish/pull-request-builder) - Check, Build and Carry your software to cloud without thinking about servers. This will build out all the resources needed to use [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and integrate with a GitHub to make a pull request builder.

[node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) - Command line tool to locally run and deploy your node.js application to [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
