# Services

## CI/CD

#### Adopt

[Serverless CI/CD](https://github.com/fogfish/pull-request-builder) - Check, Build and Carry your software to cloud without thinking about servers. This will build out all the resources needed to use [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and integrate with a GitHub to make a pull request builder.

#### Hold

[node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) - Command line tool to locally run and deploy your node.js application to [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Outdated due to AWS CDK.

## Hosting

#### Adopt

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - Simple solution for development of statis websites and blogs using markdown. Supported by GitHub out-of-the-box.
