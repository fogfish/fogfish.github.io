        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

        <p>
          Here is my personal technology radar. It helps me to follow up and
          assess upcoming technologies, to innovate on them and study news
          things. We use four rings with the following semantics:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; I do have strong confidence for that and use it when appropriate in my
            projects.</li>
          <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; The technology is under evaluation. I am still testing its limits or
            learning new things about it.</li>
          <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Worth exploring and building an understanding of how it impacts my
            projects.</li>
          <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Proceed with caution. The technology does not have a significant impact.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">ThoughtWorks</a> maintains highlights about
          currently interesting technologies in software development. As they
          said - “things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects”. It
          inspires teams to pick the best technologies and tools to get the job well done.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I maintain it?</h3>

        <p>
          Every two years, I diligently update the Tech Radar by reflecting on my projects and conducting thorough
          studies of emerging technologies. The categorization of technologies into different rings is based on
          subjective assessment, influenced by the significance of each technology to my personal projects and
          interests. This process involves evaluating the relevance, impact, and potential of various technologies,
          ensuring that the Tech Radar remains a valuable resource tailored to my specific needs and objectives.
