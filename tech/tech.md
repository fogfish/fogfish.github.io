# Technology Radar

[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) maintains a highlights about currently interesting technologies in software development. As they said - "things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects". It inspires teams to pick the best technologies and tools to get the job well done.

Here is my personal technology radar. It helps me to follow up and assess upcoming technologies, to innovate on them and study news things. Finally, the radar provides value via visibility of used technologies and gained experience curve at my professional life cycle.

   <dt>TRIAL</dt>
   <dd>Worth of evaluating. The technology is under evaluation. I am still testing its limits or learning new things about it.</dd> 

   <dt>ASSESS</dt>
