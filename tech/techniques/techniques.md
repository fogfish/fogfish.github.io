# Techniques

## Distributed System

### CAP Theorem

#### Assess

[CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed) - The CAP theorem asserts that any netÂ­worked shared-data system can have only two of three desirable properties. Aspects of the CAP theorem are often misunderstood, particularly the scope of availability and consistency, which can lead to undesirable results. Articles discusses these misleading aspects.

[Base: An Acid Alternative](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1394128) - In partitioned databases, trading some consistency for availability can lead to dramatic improvements in scalability. It discusses an applicability of persistent message queues to achieve eventual consistency and recovery from failures.


## Machine Learning

#### Assess

[MIT Deep Learning Book](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf) - This is the most comprehensive book available on the deep learning. Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.

[Breaking CAPTCHA Using Machine Learning in 0.05 Seconds](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/breaking-captcha-using-machine-learning-in-0-05-seconds-9feefb997694) - technique uses GAN networks to synthesize process of CAPTCHA generation. THe solution is extremely interesting for other problem domains with absence of large datasets. 

#### Adopt

[The Rise of Generative Adversarial Networks](https://blog.usejournal.com/the-rise-of-generative-adversarial-networks-be52d424e517) - Overview of GAN networks. They can generate high-quality images, enhance photos, generate images from text, convert images from one domain to another, change the appearance of the face image as age progresses and many more. The list is endless.


## User Experience

#### Adopt

[Design Better Forms](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c) - Highlights a common mistakes designer makes on Web Forms and How to avoid them.

[Alternatives to Placeholder Text](https://uxdesign.cc/alternatives-to-placeholder-text-13f430abc56f) - Improve form usability by addressing the perils of placeholders.
