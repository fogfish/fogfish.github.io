# Techniques

## Architecture

[Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io) and [Y-statements](https://medium.com/olzzio/y-statements-10eb07b5a177) captures a single software design choice (Architecture Decision) that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

[Architecture & Design](https://less.works/less/technical-excellence/architecture-design.html) it offers a few behavior-oriented tips related to design and large-scale development with agility, with a few noteworthy technically oriented tips–some analogous to desire lines.

[Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/) Microservices is the architecture du jour. Coming of age alongside this trend, Segment adopted this as a best practice early-on, which served us well in some cases, and, as you’ll soon learn, not so well in others.

[Designing for different states in the UI](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-different-ui-states-87d60130f85f) A common trap for designers is to only focus on creating designs that represent the perfect state of a user interface. It is easy to design for when everything is full of beautifully formatted content. But there is a problem with this. A large percentage of users experience completely different states. Ones that are missing data or full of errors.

## DevOps

[My Philosophy on Alerting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit#) When you are auditing or writing alerting rules, consider these things to keep your oncall rotation happier.

[Incident Review and Postmortem Best Practices](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/postmortem-best-practices/) One reason incidents are important is that they often reveal the real state of products, teams or organizations, which is often very different from the imaginary picture that engineering leaders have in their heads. Transparent incident reports and a good incident-handling strategy can inject much-needed realism into the development process.
