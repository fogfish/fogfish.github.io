## Zero Trust

[BeyondCorp - A New Approach to Enterprise Security](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43231.pdf) - Virtually every company today uses firewalls to enforce perimeter security. However, this security model is problematic because, when that perimeter is breached, an attacker has relatively easy access to a company’s privileged intranet. As companies adopt mobile and cloud technologies, the perimeter is becoming increasingly difficult to enforce. Google is taking a different approach to network security. We are removing the requirement for a privileged intranet and moving our corporate applications to the Internet.

[BeyondCorp - Design to Deployment at Google](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44860.pdf) - Unlike the conventional perimeter security model, BeyondCorp doesn’t gate access to services and tools based on a user’s physical location or the originating network; instead, access policies are based on information about a device, its state, and its associated user.
