## Functional programming

#### Assess

[Modular Type Classes](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/mtc/main-long.pdf) - ML modules and Haskell type classes have proven to be highly effective tools for program structuring. Modules emphasize explicit configuration of program components and the use of data abstraction. Type classes emphasize implicit program construction and ad hoc polymorphism. In this paper, we show how the implicitly- typed style of type class programming may be supported within the framework of an explicitly-typed module language by viewing type classes as a particular mode of use of modules.


#### Adopt

[Implementing, and Understanding Type Classes](http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/typeclass.html) - This page looks behind the scenes of the abstraction of parametric overloading, also known as bounded polymorphism, or just `type classes`. Seeing the implementation makes type classes appear simpler, friendlier, more comfortable to use.

[Solving Embarrassingly Obvious Problems in Erlang](https://blog.usejournal.com/solving-embarrassingly-obvious-problems-in-erlang-e3f21a6203cc) - the article is helpful for any one how commits large function. It guides about decomposition of large functions using real life example. The technique is applicable to any language despite it refers to Erlang.
