This tutorial shows a Type-level programming techniques in TypeScript. What type-level programming is, and how to introduce it in our codebase helps us to reach more exact type definitions, thus reducing the bugs in our code. Starting from a practical example we will see the basic patterns, limits and potential. [See the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxO2aJ_ibek)

[TYPESCRIPT TYPE INFERENCE GUIDE](http://ducin.it/typescript-type-inference-guide) - Type Inference is one of the most important features we should master, as we progress with using TypeScript. One of the most useful resources when getting started with TypeScript is the official handbook. However, it doesn't go too deep into type inference and doesn't provide practical tips on how to leverage it.
