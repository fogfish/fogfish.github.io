# Technology Radar 2024 

## What is the Tech Radar?

[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) maintains highlights about currently interesting technologies in software development. As they said - “things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects”. It inspires teams to pick the best technologies and tools to get the job well done.

Here is my personal technology radar. It helps me to follow up and assess upcoming technologies, to innovate on them and study news things. Despite the fact that the radar is written using impersonal language, it provides value via visibility of used technologies and gained experience curve at my professional life cycle.

## How is it made?

**Quadrants**. The radar is built on topic areas - quadrants. Each quadrant maintains blips and a list of knowledge materials which helps progressing with development.
* [Techniques and Theories](/tech/techniques-and-theories.md). These include elements of a software engineering process, such as theories (e.g. queueing, functional programming), architecture practices and patterns, experience design, etc.

* [Platforms and Systems](/tech/platforms-and-systems.md). Things that we build software on top of such as cloud platforms, operating systems, or generic kinds of platforms like distributes or actor systems.

* [Tools and Technologies](/tech/tools-and-technologies.md). Standalone software components such as databases, software development tools, such as versions' control systems; or more generic categories of productivity tools.

* [Languages and Frameworks](/tech/languages-and-frameworks.md). These include programming languages like Go, Java and Python and frameworks Flutter, React.js and Gin, etc.

**Rings**. Blips belong to one of the rings on the radar, emphasizing its importance and applicability for my projects.

* ![Adopt](https://img.shields.io/badge/adopt-d9ecc0?style=flat-square) I do have strong confidence for that and use it when appropriate in my projects.
*  ![Trial](https://img.shields.io/badge/trial-cadae0?style=flat-square) The technology is under evaluation. I am still testing its limits or learning new things about it.
* ![Assess](https://img.shields.io/badge/assess-fbe6a8?style=flat-square) Worth exploring and building an understanding of how it impacts my projects.
* ![Hold](https://img.shields.io/badge/hold-f7d1ca?style=flat-square) Proceed with caution. The technology does not have a significant impact.


## How do I maintain it?

Every two years, I diligently update the Tech Radar by reflecting on my projects and conducting thorough studies of emerging technologies. The categorization of technologies into different rings is based on subjective assessment, influenced by the significance of each technology to my personal projects and interests. This process involves evaluating the relevance, impact, and potential of various technologies, ensuring that the Tech Radar remains a valuable resource tailored to my specific needs and objectives.
