# Technologies

## Machine Learning

[MIT Deep Learning Book](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf) - This is the most comprehensive book available on the deep learning. Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.

[Breaking CAPTCHA Using Machine Learning in 0.05 Seconds](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/breaking-captcha-using-machine-learning-in-0-05-seconds-9feefb997694) - technique uses GAN networks to synthesize process of CAPTCHA generation. THe solution is extremely interesting for other problem domains with absence of large datasets. 

[The Rise of Generative Adversarial Networks](https://blog.usejournal.com/the-rise-of-generative-adversarial-networks-be52d424e517) - Overview of GAN networks. They can generate high-quality images, enhance photos, generate images from text, convert images from one domain to another, change the appearance of the face image as age progresses and many more. The list is endless.

[Don't Throw Out Your Algorithms Book Just Yet: Classical Data Structures That Can Outperform Learned Indexes](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/2018/01/11/index-baselines/) New proposal from authors at Google: to replace conventional indexing data structures like B-trees and hash maps by instead fitting a neural network to the dataset. The paper compares such learned indexes against several standard data structures and reports promising results.

## CI/CD

[Serverless CI/CD](https://github.com/fogfish/pull-request-builder) - Check, Build and Carry your software to cloud without thinking about servers. This will build out all the resources needed to use [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) and integrate with a GitHub to make a pull request builder.

[node-lambda](https://github.com/motdotla/node-lambda) - Command line tool to locally run and deploy your node.js application to [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Outdated due to AWS CDK.
